# PoKeMap_GUI
G.U.I for PokemonGo-Map
This G.U.I is for PokemonGoMap. Dont want to deal with the commadLine? Use this. Currrently works with PokemonGoMap V2.0, will add support for V1.0. Will save your logIn info and Location if you want to. 

If you get an error after setting Python and PoGoMap Directory simply restart app so Settings can take effect.
